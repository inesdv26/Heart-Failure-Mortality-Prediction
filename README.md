# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction: Data Analysis and Modelling

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to predict the mortality of patients with heart failure using machine learning techniques. 

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 12 features related to heart failure patients, including clinical measurements and demographics. The primary objective is to analyze this data and develop a predictive model.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset for missing values, outliers and understanding the distribution of features.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalizing data and addressing any class imbalances.
3. **Model Development**: Training multiple machine learning models to predict patient mortality.
4. **Evaluation**: Utilizing various metrics to assess model performance and explainability through SHAP values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SHAP

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and run the notebook to see the analysis in action. Adjust model parameters and explore different techniques for enhancing prediction accuracy.
